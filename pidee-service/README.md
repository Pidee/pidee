# Pidee Service

## Getting started

You can likely skip step one if pidee has been install via the package manager.

1. Run **pidee-service** with `sudo bin/pidee-service`*
2. In another session, try out **pidee-cli** with `bin/pidee-cli`

### Examples

Run the following examples from the `pidee/bin` folder (with `cd bin`)

#### Turn on the yellow LED

`./pidee-cli set led.yellow 1`

#### Turn off the yellow LED

`./pidee-cli set led.yellow 0`

### Get the value of the dip switches

`./pidee-cli get dip`

_Voil√†! You have id'ed the pi the with a Pidee!_

### Get the value of the third dip switch

`./pidee-cli get dip.2`

### See if the button is pressed

`./pidee-cli get button`

### Get all switches and button values

`./pidee-cli get all`

### Set all the LEDs to off

`./pidee-cli set led 0`

### Set all the LEDs on

`./pidee-cli set led 0`

_Intrigued? You can set the three LEDs at once using a binary bitmask_

### Listen for the button to be pressed or lifted

`./pidee-cli subscribe button`

*Push `Ctrl-C` to quit it*

### Listen for the dip switch to change

`./pidee-cli subscribe dip`

### Listen for the 6th dip switch to change

`./pidee-cli subscribe dip.6`

### Listen any changes to the dip or the switch

`./pidee-cli subscribe all`

## Developers (How to communicate with pidee-service )

In the examples above `pidee-cli` sends commands to the pidee service via a unix socket files. Check the [Protocol Document](Protocol.md) for more info on how the commands are structures. If you want to test the protocol you can do so in the terminal. Here is an example:

```
echo "#foo led.yellow SET 1" | nc -U /tmp/pidee.sock
``

The command, which is defined in the protocol documents, is `#foo led.yellow SET 1`. `nc` is a utility to write to the socket. Most programming languages will give you a way to do this. Of course, you can ditch pidee-service all together and just use the GPIO on the rasppbery pi directly. Checkout the schmantic for the board here LINK TO GO HERE.
