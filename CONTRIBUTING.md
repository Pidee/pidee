An initial working strategy:

+ _Minor typo/grammar changes_: OK to be made on `theworkers/pidee/master` (as this is aided by Github Web GUI)

+ _Fixes_: create a branch called `fix-some-name`, work on it, make sure your branch is up to date with `theworkers/pidee/master` then create a pull request

+ _New things_: create a branch called `feature-some-name`, make sure your branch is up to date with `theworkers/pidee/master` then create a pull request
